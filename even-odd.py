# Write a Python program that reads a text file named numbers.txt that contains 20 integers. 
# The program will create two other text file; the first text file will be named even.txt that will contains all even numbers extracted from the numbers.txt. 
# The second text file will be named odd.txt that will contains all odd numbers extracted from the numbers.txt.

# open numbers.txt , even.txt, and odd.txt

    # read number.txt by line
        # convert each line to integer
        # if extracted number is even
            # put extracted number to even.txt
        # else if the extracted number is odd
            # put extracted number to odd.txt
